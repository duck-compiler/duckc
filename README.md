# 🐥 Duck - The programming language for modern full-stack web-development
Welcome to the official repository of the Duck programming language!

Duck is a modern, compiled and batteries included programming language for full-stack web-development, that's built on top of the go ecosystem, it leverages the concepts of duck-typing onto a fast and reliable platform while introducing JSX like server-side templating and client-side react components as first-class citizens.

This repository hosts the source code for [Duck](https://duck-lang.org). It contains the compiler, it's build tool [dargo](https://github.com/duck-compiler/duck-spielwiese/blob/main/docs/002-dargo.md), the standard library and documentation.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:duck-compiler/duckc.git
cd duckc
cargo install --path .
```

This will install dargo onto your system.

### NOTE:

At the current state of the compiler we don't allow any pull requests apart from out core team.
Development is actively running (probably on another branch) and we're also not open for issues yet. But we're open to discuss topics on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/J6Q7qyeESM)
